MODULE GroundupTracer EXPORTS Main;

(* A bare-bones system that works like the one in RTftGU ch. 3.

   Global variables and free-standing procedures are used here in
   place of classes (p. 62 summarizes a better, extensible
   design). The main reason for using a different design here is to
   better understand the code in ch. 3 (re-formulation aids
   comprehension). The resulting program is shorter, too. *)
